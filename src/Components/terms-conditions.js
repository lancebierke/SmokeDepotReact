          <h2>Battery Warning</h2>
          <p>
            CAUTION: There is an inherent risk with the use of any and all
            rechargeable batteries in any circumstance. Use special caution when
            working with Li-ion (Lithium-ion), LiPo (Lithium-ion Polymer) and
            any rechargeable cells, as they are very sensitive to charging
            characteristics and may explode or burn if mishandled. Make sure the
            user has enough knowledge of Li-ion (Lithium-ion), LiPo (Lithium-ion
            Polymer) and any rechargeable cells in charging, discharging,
            assembly and storage before use. Always charge in/on a fire-proof
            surface. Never leave charging batteries unattended. Do not use any
            rechargeable battery as well as any battery charger if any visible
            damage is present, as well as if the cell or charger has been
            stressed through mishandling, accidental or otherwise, even if
            damage may not be visible. Always store and transport rechargeable
            cells in a safe, non-conductive container in a controlled
            environment. Dispose of all battery cells and chargers in accordance
            to local laws and mandates. Do not use chargers purchased outside of
            www.smokedepotlv.com. Doing so may cause damage to the battery and
            malfunctions which can cause serious injuries. We are not
            responsible for damage of any modification to the batteries in form
            or shape. We are not responsible for any damage caused by misuse or
            mishandling of Li-ion (Lithium-ion), LiPo (Lithium-ion Polymer) and
            any rechargeable cells.
          </p>
          <p>
            WARNING: Lithium Polymer batteries (LiPo or Li-Po) and Lithium Ion
            batteries (Li-Ion) have a very high energy density (A-Hrs. to weight
            ratio) compared to NiMH, NiCd's, or other batteries. That high
            energy density means that there's is also an increased risk when
            using them. Because of this, we at Vape Street and any and all of
            Smoke Depot parent and subsidiary companies recommend extreme
            caution in their use, and are informing you of the risks that come
            with using these types of batteries. The main risk is FIRE or
            EXPLOSION which can result from improper charging, physical damage,
            or short circuiting the LiPo, Li-Ion and all rechargeable batteries.
            We must stress that all lithium and all rechargeable batteries be
            used with extreme caution and attention in order to prevent any
            dangerous situations. Houses, garages, and shops have also burned as
            the result of a lithium battery fire! Due to the close proximity of
            rechargeable batteries to the user as per the nature of usage, these
            risks are increased and may result in great physical harm!
